                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I grown up in Fort Worth, Texas, and started my own family here. My Journey into tech started
                        with
                        me fixing all of my friends computers needs. Nothing was impossible for me I would just research
                        until
                        the job was finished. I was fascinated with how easy it was to fix anything. I then became
                        hooked and
                        wanted to learn how to build web sites so I could help those even further!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first
                        website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for
                        in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my
                        organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content
                        is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean
                        and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
